# Lightsped-demo-using-Vagrant
Server provisioning on Vagrant with Ansible generated by WCA for Ansible Lightspeed

Objective is to create and Ansible file using Lightspeed auto-completion capabilities and run the Vagrant server up to see if everything works as expected.

In a summary, this is what our ansible playbook should do.

1. Load the variables file vars.yaml 
2. Download and Install the EPEL release RPM ( from internet)
3. Install Apache HTTPD Webserver
4. Copy the template *.j2 (Jinja2) files to the destination after 
   replacing the variables in J2 file with the corresponding values 
   taken from our variables declaration file vars.yaml
5. Create a Document root directory
6. Connect to the 'www.mydomain.com' and download the home page and save 
   it as index.html under document root ( Default page for our site)
7. Restart the Apache HTTPD process
